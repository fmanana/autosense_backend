# AutoSense Express Web API

This project contains the `Express.js` REST API that implements CRUD operations for stations. The API has not deployed
and will therefore need to be run locally.

## Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

To install the npm packages navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
```bash
npm install
```
### 2. Build and Run

To build and run the project run the following commands:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
This will build and start the API server on `http://localhost:4000`. Note: the build directory is set to `dist/`.
